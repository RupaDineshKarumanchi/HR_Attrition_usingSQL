# Project Overview

This project is the second part of Capstone 1, where the focus shifts from Python-based analysis (Part 1) to SQL-based analysis (Part 2).
In this phase, I used SQLite3 to analyze an HR Analytics dataset and gain insights into employee attrition. The goal was to calculate attrition rates, 
analyze trends across demographics, and explore the underlying reasons behind employee turnover.

# Objectives

1. Create a SQLite3 database from the provided CSV dataset.
2. Perform SQL queries to calculate attrition rates across multiple dimensions.
3. Analyze attrition patterns to identify key factors influencing employee turnover.
4. Effectively communicate insights using a combination of SQL queries, results, and markdown explanations in Jupyter Notebook.

# Tools & Technologies

1. Python 3
2. SQLite3
3. Pandas (for data handling)
4. Jupyter Notebook (for queries, visualizations, and communication of insights)
